Genesis Replicator is a comprehensive framework for developing autonomous AI agents in Web3 environments.

## System Architecture Overview

The Genesis Replicator framework implements a layered architecture comprising five primary layers, each designed to handle specific aspects of autonomous agent operations in blockchain environments.

### 1. Application Layer

The Application Layer serves as the primary interface for external interactions, containing three key components:

**Client SDK**

- Provides programmatic access to the framework
- Implements standardized interfaces for agent interactions
- Handles authentication and session management

**API Gateway**

- Manages external API requests
- Implements rate limiting and security policies
- Handles request routing and load balancing

**Admin Interface**

- Provides system management capabilities
- Enables configuration and monitoring
- Supports administrative operations
